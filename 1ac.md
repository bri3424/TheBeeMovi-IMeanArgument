Harm1: Bees Dying
	The number of managed colonies in the United States for honey production has been in decline since the 1940s. In 1998, there were 5 million hives in america. As of 2015, there were 2.5 million.
	Impact: Environment

	Impact: Agriculture

Plan: The USFG should ban all neonics
	Enforcement: EPA/USDA
	Timeline: Next growing season
	Funding: Not necessary

Solvency: Banning eliminates use

Advantage: Neuronicotinoids are a danger to public health. In the article "EFSA assesses potential link between two neonicotinoids and developmental neurotoxicity" http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/131217, the EFSA says quote: "The PPR Panel found that acetamiprid  and imidacloprid {both neonicitinoids} may affect the development of neurons and brain structures {in humans} associated with functions such as learning and memory. It {is} concluded that some current levels for acceptable exposure to acetamiprid and imidacloprid may not be protective enough to safeguard against developmental neurotoxicity and should be reduced."  From the NRDC (natural resource defense council) QUOTE "The pesticides are designed to target the insect nervous system – this is how they are effective insecticides... [It causes] havoc with the affected nerve cell and ultimately killing a target insect within hours or days." Unquote. It can also damage parts of the brain involving fetal growth, muscle contraction, learning, and the ability to pay attention.

Unq: Bees Dead

Harm2: Gets into drinking water
	A study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that QUOTE "neonics are widespread contaminants of surface and ground water that could be a source of drinking water... Limited testing from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has found neonics in fruits and vegetables, where the pesticide’s systemic nature means it cannot be washed off the surface of these foods." UNQUOTE
	
Plan: Ban neonics again! (see previous plan)

Solvency: Banning eliminates use :D

Unq: People getting nervous system damage. From the NRDC (natural resource defense council) QUOTE "The pesticides are designed to target the insect nervous system – this is how they are effective insecticides... [It causes] havoc with the affected nerve cell and ultimately killing a target insect within hours or days." Unquote. It can also damage parts of the brain involving fetal growth, muscle contraction, learning, and the ability to pay attention.

MPX: PEOPLE DIE (probably)
